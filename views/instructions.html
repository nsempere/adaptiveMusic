        <p>You will be performing four n-back tasks, which are described below. For each task, you will hear a different
            version of the same song playing. The task will finish before the end of the song. When it is finished, continue listening
            to the song and use the tool on the right to report your perception of the song.</p>

        <h4>The N-Back Task</h4>
        <p>The n-back is a standard test of working memory and attention. In this task, you will see a 3x3 grid with
        one square filled. You should memorize which square is filled and also indicate whether or not the filled
        square is in the same location as it was n iterations ago. When n is 1, you will indicate whether the square
        is in the same position as it was in the previous slide. When n is 2, you will indicate whether the square is
        in the same position it was two slides ago. Use the right arrow key to indicate a match and the left arrow key
        to indicate a non-match. We will track both how fast you respond and your mean accuracy. Your first two tasks will be
        one-backs and the second two will be two-backs.</p>
